The Scream/Laugh Canister is an object in the Disney/Pixar Monsters, Inc. franchise. Their purpose is <b>to store up the scream energy of human kids that the Scarers collect</b>.

The ingredients of this yummy concoction include tentacles, seawater, mercury, sulfuric acid, lead, bile, blood, sweat, tears, anemone, deadly pufferfish, and depleted uranium (to preserve freshness).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><h2>Are Mike Wazowski and Sully dating?</h2><p>In the film there is <b>a “queering”</b> of the relationship between the two lead characters and there are several obvious nods that they are in fact a couple. They bicker like a couple, take care of each other like a couple and banter like a couple. To all intents and purposes they are a couple.</p><p>How does wazowski poop?</p><p>He <b>poops through his mouth</b>, and he has some sort of coating he can put over his tongue so that he doesn’t taste anything. He has a hole that opens only when he needs to poop, similar to how humans have the epiglottis stopping us from drinking food and eating water, although it’s almost reversed.</p><p>What does Schmoopsie poo mean? <b>I love you</b>, Schmoopsie-poo! Move it! Je t’aime, ma Bichounette ! I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!</p><p>What is Boo’s real name?

Fans of the film might remember; when one monster — George — returns from the other side with a tiny sock stuck to his back.</p><p>Why do the monsters scare children in Monsters, Inc? They work together to scare as many children as they can so that <b>the children’s screams can be stored and converted into energy for the city of Monstropolis</b>. … Because monsters believe children are toxic, Sully is frightened and asks Mike about what to do with Boo.</p><p>What do screams give the city of Monstropolis?</p><p>In a world inhabited by monsters, the city of Monstropolis harnesses the <b>screams of human children for energy</b>.</p><h2></h2><p>Don’t forget to share this post !</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brnRZq6arJWnu7C70p5kmp6kmr9uuc6nqq2doqh6qrrCZmpmbWFrg3l7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Mr%20waternoose%20after%20Monsters%2c%20Inc%3f%20%20Celebrity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Mr%20waternoose%20after%20Monsters%2c%20Inc%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Mr%20waternoose%20after%20Monsters%2c%20Inc%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Mr%20waternoose%20after%20Monsters%2c%20Inc%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-mr-waternoose-after-monsters-inc-3-51668.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Mr%20waternoose%20after%20Monsters%2c%20Inc%3f%20%20Celebrity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./will-trent-season-2-finale-why-sara-linton-may-get-her-own-spin-off-exclusive.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Will Trent star Iantha Richardsonbreaks down 'heartbreaking' season two finale  and why Sara Li">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vinny-curry.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vinny Curry">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
