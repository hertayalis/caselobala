He was often hailed as Canada’s greatest songwriter, and was widely known as a folk-rock legend.</p><p>Gordon Lightfoot’s talent and extensive repertoire of timeless songs about trains, shipwrecks, rivers, highways, lovers, and loneliness brought him wide recognition in the 1960s.</p><p>Some of his most popular songs, including “For Lovin’ Me,” “Early Morning Rain,” “Steel Rail Blues,” and “Black Day in July” gained popularity both in Canada and abroad. Lightfoot achieved chart success in the US in the 1970s with hits like “If You Could Read My Mind,” “Sundown,” “Carefree Highway,” “Rainy Day People,” and “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.”</p><p>Throughout his career, Gordon Lightfoot’s albums achieved gold and multi-platinum status internationally, and his songs were recorded by many legendary artists, such as Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams Jr., Jerry Lee Lewis, Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Judy Collins, Harry Belafonte, the Grateful Dead, Olivia Newton-John, and Jim Croce. He was also the inspiration for the song “Lightfoot” by The Guess Who.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Lightfoot</a> was highly regarded by fellow musicians, with Robbie Robertson of The Band calling him a “national treasure,” and Bob Dylan describing him as one of his favourite songwriters. In fact, Lightfoot was a mentor to Dylan for many years.</p><p>In recognition of his contributions to the arts, Gordon Lightfoot was awarded several prestigious accolades, such as an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Trent University, Companion of the Order of Canada, Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.</p><p>He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2012 and received an honorary doctorate of music from Lakehead University in his hometown of Orillia in 2015. Lightfoot’s legacy will continue to live on through his timeless music and the countless lives he touched with his artistry.</p><p>His death comes after a decline in his health drastically forcing him to cancel his 2023 tour. His death has been attributed to natural causes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Gordon Lightfoot Awards and Honours</h2><p>Gordon Lightfoot has received numerous awards and honors throughout his career. He has won sixteen Juno Awards, including top folk singer in 1965, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977, top male vocalist in 1967, 1970, 1971, 1972, and 1973, and composer of the year in 1972 and 1976.

In addition, he was named Canadian male recording artist of the decade in 1980 for his work in the 1970s.</p><p>Lightfoot has been inducted into several halls of fame, including the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1986, the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame in 2001, and Canada’s Walk of Fame in 1998. He was also made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 2003, which is the country’s highest civilian honor, and a member of the Order of Ontario, which is the highest honor in the province of Ontario. In 1977, he received the Vanier Award from the Canadian Jaycees. In 2007, Canada Post honored Lightfoot and three other Canadian music artists with postage stamps featuring their names and images.</p><p>In 2012, Lightfoot was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in a ceremony held in New York City, alongside Bob Seger. He was also awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by SOCAN at the 2014 SOCAN Awards in Toronto, and in 2015, a 4-meter tall bronze sculpture called Golden Leaves—A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot was erected in his hometown of Orillia, Ontario. The sculpture depicts Lightfoot sitting cross-legged, playing an acoustic guitar underneath an arch of golden maple leaves. In 2017, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society and was ranked fifth in the CBC’s list of the 25 best Canadian songwriters ever.</p><p>In 2019, a documentary titled Gordon Lightfoot: If You Could Read My Mind was released, chronicling his life and career. In 2022, Lightfoot received the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jqCmq5yfo3qttcahq5%2Bnn6l6osPAq5usZZGjsW60zqemrqqjZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html&text=Gordon%20Lightfoot%20Awards%20and%20Honours&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html&title=Gordon%20Lightfoot%20Awards%20and%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html&title=Gordon%20Lightfoot%20Awards%20and%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html&title=Gordon%20Lightfoot%20Awards%20and%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgordon-lightfoot-awards-and-honours.html&description=Gordon%20Lightfoot%20Awards%20and%20Honours" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./holly-deveaux.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Holly Deveaux">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adam-calhoun-net-worth-280898.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Calhoun Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
