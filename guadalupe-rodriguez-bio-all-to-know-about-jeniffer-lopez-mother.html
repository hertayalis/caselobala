She is also the mother of Lynda Lopez, a journalist who has won an Emmy.</p><p>According to her own daughter, Guadalupe Rodriguez is a “big gambler” who once won $2.4 million at The Borgata Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Guadalupe was prominently featured in her daughter Jennifer’s 2012 “Dance Again World Tour,” which was turned into the HBO concert film “Jennifer Lopez: Dance Again” and broadcast on New Year’s Eve 2015, portraying her as an exaggerated figure who aspired to be a celebrity herself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-guadalupe-rodriguez-bio><strong>Guadalupe Rodríguez bio</strong></h2><p>Guadalupe “Lupe” Rodrguez was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, on December 12, 1945. Rodriguez was Julia’s mother. She worked as a school employee and a Tupperware salesperson after growing up.</p><p>Her marriage to David Lopez, who had previously worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company before becoming a computer technician there, however, led to her becoming a homemaker. Leslie Ann Lopez was born in 1967; Jennifer Lynn Lopez was born in 1969; and Lynda Elaine Lopez was born in 1971. The couple had three daughters together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Read Also: <a href=#>Sheletta Chapital bio: Who is Anthony Mackie’s ex-wife?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Guadalupe Rodríguez appearance</strong></h2><p>Guadalupe, a 75-year-old socialite, is attractive on the outside and admirable on the inside.

Despite being parents of Latino descent, they stressed to their kids the value of speaking English well. They placed a strong emphasis on instilling a work ethic in their kids. She objected to Jennifer leaving college to pursue an acting career, which ultimately led to Jennifer having to leave their house and move into an apartment in Manhattan.</p><p>Leslie, her eldest daughter, is a singer and a teacher. She is married to Bob Scholl and the couple has two kids, Steven and Brendon. Jennifer, the middle child, is presently dating Alex Rodriguez and has twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. Lynda, her youngest child, is a journalist who has won a “Emmy Award” and has experience in both radio and television.

She has worked as a social worker and a teacher in the past. She has served as her daughters’ greatest source of inspiration. Jennifer Rodriguez’s decision to forgo her studies in order to pursue an acting career was not one that Rodriguez supported. But Lopez rose to fame as a popular figure.</p><p>Guadalupe has frequently been sighted with Lopez in public since the star rose to popularity. Guadalupe also appeared in Jennifer Lopez: Dance Again, her daughter’s concert film, and the Obama administration’s #YourMomCares campaign in 2014. In January 2015, the celebrity appeared alongside Lopez on The Wendy William Show in New York.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Additionally, Rodriguez made headlines in the beginning of 2015 after Jennifer revealed that her mother had once won $2.4 million at the Borgata Casino’s slot machines.

She accidently got elbowed by a zealous fan while attempting to get a closer look at the celebrity.</p><p>Despite her wincing from the injury, Rodriguez moved forward while holding the side of her face. When Lopez became enraged, she wrapped her mother’s hand around her to shield her.</p><p>Guadalupe hasn’t been linked to any other contentious issues or speculations other from that up until now.</p><p>It appears that Rodriguez prefers to live a fulfilling personal life and does not wish to combine it with her career.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCz1JqbmqSlpbJuvs6dqaKfpZrHbq7IqGSapJxiwbB5yqemsGWRl7y2wIyjnKehlpuys3nLqKeesl2ivLW0xKtm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html&text=Guadalupe%20Rodrguez%20bio%3a%20All%20to%20know%20about%20Jeniffer%20Lopez%20mother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html&title=Guadalupe%20Rodrguez%20bio%3a%20All%20to%20know%20about%20Jeniffer%20Lopez%20mother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html&title=Guadalupe%20Rodrguez%20bio%3a%20All%20to%20know%20about%20Jeniffer%20Lopez%20mother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html&title=Guadalupe%20Rodrguez%20bio%3a%20All%20to%20know%20about%20Jeniffer%20Lopez%20mother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fguadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html&description=Guadalupe%20Rodrguez%20bio%3a%20All%20to%20know%20about%20Jeniffer%20Lopez%20mother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vicky-mcclure-new-drama-what-are-viewers-critics-saying.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Line of Duty star Vicky McClures intense new drama Insomnia worth the watch?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ex-wife of Florida death row serial killer says he is getting what he deserves">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
