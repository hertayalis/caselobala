There he played for&nbsp;Florida State Seminoles football&nbsp;team from the year 2003 to 2004.</p><p>Initially, Antonio‚Äôs football career started at his high school. But his professional career started from the year 2006 when he joined the&nbsp;San Diego Chargers at the age of 22. He had signed a five-year contract with San Diego and finished the session in 2009.</p><p>He&nbsp;was then traded to the&nbsp;New York Jets&nbsp;for a third-round draft pick in the&nbsp;2011 NFL Draft&nbsp;on March 4, 2010. But it later turned into a second-round pick based on Antonio‚Äôs performance. He was elected to attend the Pro Bowl as a replacement after the 2013 season. In his career, it was his third election.</p><p>Antonio then signed a one-year contract with the&nbsp;Arizona Cardinals&nbsp;on 19th of March 2014.
