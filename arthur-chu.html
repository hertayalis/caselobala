Arthur made a Final Jeopardy! bet that made him tie individual candidate Carolyn Collins on the January 29 episode. Chu asserted that he settled on the choice to bet for a tie not out of generosity but because of the guidance of 2003 College champion Keith Williams, who guarantees that game hypothesis favors betting for a tie over the more typical act of betting to win by a dollar.</p><p>But on the January 30 episode, Chu defeated Collins. After a three-week airtime break, on February 24, he became eligible for the Tournament of Champions when he won for the fifth time; his total winnings were $123,600.

In the 2014 Jeopardy! Tournament of Champions Chu competed where he finished second to Ben Ingram, an IT consultant from South Carolina. Chu won $100,000 for his second-place finish, bringing his overall winnings to $398,200.</p><h2><strong>Arthur Chu Response to the gameplay style</strong></h2><p>His aggressive style of play attracted criticism among fans of the series, throughout his 11-game streak, some of whom considered his conduct to be unsportsmanlike and against the spirit of Jeopardy! His master plan earned him the nickname the “Jeopardy! Villain”, a nickname he fully took up. The most common complaints about his playing style claimed that he jumped from category to category, a procedure known as the “Forrest Bounce” after former champion Chuck Forrest.</p><p>He was successful past champions, including <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a> and <a href=#>Brad Rutter</a>, who have used the Forrest Bounce strategy like Chu, used it to increase their odds of finding Daily Doubles first. Chu picked high-value clues first because they are more likely to be Daily Doubles following inspiration by Watson, a computer that was programmed to play Jeopardy!. Chu wagered $5 on a Daily Double and responded “I don’t know” immediately after the clue was given in his second game.</p><p>Chu having held the buzzer close to the microphone, resulted in audible clicks when signaling and upon correctly answering a question, rushed quickly to the next clue. This gamesmanship he portrayed, resulted in criticism and his engagement with critics on Twitter during airings of his shows led some to declare his run similar to a Moneyball moment, and Chu a “ruthless” and “idol-killingly pragmatic”.</p><p>Jennings has defended Chu as a “good player” together with Trebek and who makes the game “more exciting”. Trebek admitted that Chu’s use of the Forest Bounce in when it disrupted the flow of the game, could be irritating although he also praised Chu and said that as the impartial host he accept disorder while in a 2018 interview.</p><p><strong>After Jeopardy!</strong></p><p>Chu contacted publicists and PR firms after his appearance on Jeopardy! to request proposals on the most proficient method to adapt the acknowledgment from his Jeopardy! run. Chu started writing a column for The Daily Beast, after he found the proposals unappealing, and did not follow suggestions that he use the ‘successful game theorist’ image and later wrote for Salon. On being Asian American, Chu has written on various aspects of nerd culture.</p><p>Apart from his opposition to the Gamergate movement, he is a vocal critic of racism and online bullying. A documentary feature film directed by Scott Drucker and Yu Gu about Chu’s life, titled Who Is Arthur Chu?, premiered at the 2017 Slam dance Film Festival.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><h2>Who is Arthur Chu?</h2><p>He is a well known American columnist and former contestant on the syndicated U.S. game show Jeopardy!</p><h2>How old is Arthur Chu?</h2><p>He is 36 years of age as of 2020 and was born on January 30, 1984, in Albany, New York, United States.</p><h2>How tall is Arthur Chu?</h2><p>He stands tall at a height of 5 feet 5¾ inches (1.67 m).</p><h2>Is Arthur Chu married?</h2><p>He got married to Eliza Blair in 2012, a fellow Swarthmore College graduate but later divorced in 2016.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><span id=ez-clearholder-leader-3></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-3 leader-3704 adtester-container adtester-container-704" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-3><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-3-0 ezaw=580 ezah=400 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=704><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=462a400c-7e33-4563-7b68-d1a38b3d8e57&ad_position_id=704&impression_group_id=informationcradle_com-leader-3/2024-01-08/9006891666826034&ad_size=580x400&domain_id=484579&url=https://informationcradle.com/arthur-chu/" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h2>How much is Arthur Chu worth?</h2><p>His annual estimated net worth is still under review.</p><h2>How much does Arthur Chu make?</h2><p>According to our reliable sources, his annual estimated salary is yet to be updated.</p><h2>Where does Arthur Chu live?</h2><p>Currently, he resides in Broadview Heights, Ohio.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_16"></span><span id=ez-clearholder-leader-4></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 leader-4 leader-4711 adtester-container adtester-container-711" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-leader-4><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-leader-4-0 ezaw=300 ezah=250 class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span data-nosnippet class=reportline data-ez-ph-owner-id=711><span class=ezoicwhat><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/go.ezodn.com/utilcave_com/ezoicbwa.png alt=Ezoic title=ezoic name="?pageview_id=462a400c-7e33-4563-7b68-d1a38b3d8e57&ad_position_id=711&impression_group_id=informationcradle_com-leader-4/2024-01-08/3469435780793109&ad_size=300x250&domain_id=484579&url=https://informationcradle.com/arthur-chu/" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></span><h2>Is Arthur Chu dead or alive?</h2><p>Arthur is alive and in good health.
