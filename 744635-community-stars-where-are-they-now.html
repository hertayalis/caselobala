Armed with a loyal fanbase who followed the series from cancellation to revival, to a late-game streaming pivot, to another, more permanent cancellation, Community has maintained cultural relevancy in recent years by moving their entire library to Netflix.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Series creator Dan Harmon has been diligently reassembling the team for the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming Community movie</a>, scheduled to stream on Peacock. Of course, since the series aired its final episode in 2015, each of the core seven actors who comprised Greendale Community College's illustrious study group have moved on to other projects.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-joel-mchale>Joel McHale</h2></span><p>HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 09: Joel McHale attends the BoxLunch Holiday Gala 2023 celebrating Feeding America on November 09, 2023 in Hollywood, California.

Since Community aired its final episode, McHale has starred in his own Netflix series The Joel McHale Show With Joel McHale, as well as the Netflix original film A Futile And Stupid Gesture. In the latter, he portrayed his Community co-star Chevy Chase. Though McHale has appeared in a handful of other network shows, including CBS's The Great Indoors and Fox's Animal Control, none have seen as much success and cult-like admiration as Community.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-alison-brie>Alison Brie</h2></span><p>PARK CITY, UTAH - JANUARY 26: Alison Brie of 'Horse Girl' attends the IMDb Studio at Acura Festival Village on location at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival – Day 3 on January 26, 2020 in Park City, Utah.

Alison Brie has also starred in several feature films, including romantic comedies like Sleeping with Other People, Somebody I Used To Know and Spin Me Round.

In the time since the show concluded, Pudi has lent his voice to animated works. Some of his credits include Duck Tales, Smurfs: The Lost Village, Harvey Girls Forever, Transformers: Earthspark, and Strange Planet. Pudi also reunited with Community writer Megan Ganz in the Rob McElhenney-created series Mythic Quest.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gillian-jacobs>Gillian Jacobs</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - MAY 22: Gillian Jacobs discusses "Ibiza" with the Build Series at Build Studio on May 22, 2018 in New York City.

Her post-Community credits include Don't Think Twice, Lemon, Winning Time: The Rise of the Laker's Dynasty, Invincible, and the Judd Apatow-created Netflix series Love. Like many of her Community co-stars, Jacobs' also appeared in a cameo voice role in Rick and Morty. Jacobs' Rick and Morty character, Supernova, led a web-based spin-off series of <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the adult cartoon</a> called The Vindicators.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-yvette-nicole-brown>Yvette Nicole Brown</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 22: Member of EMILY’s List Board of Directors, Yvette Nicole Brown attends the EMILY's List Oscars Week Discussion on March 22, 2022 in Los Angeles, California.

Beside small cameo appearances in Avengers: Endgame and DC League of Super-Pets, Nicole Brown has also frequented series such as Talking Dead and Hollywood Game Night. The <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> and Josh alumni also secured an Emmy nomination in 2021 for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

With a career which spans over 5 decades, Chase's credits have been few and far between since the sitcom went off the air. Chase went on to star in projects including Hot Tub Time Machine 2, The Last Laugh, and Panda Vs. Aliens. Chevy Chase also <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">courted controversy</a> during his tenure on Community, prompting many of the cast and crew to refuse to work with him again. The show killed off Chase's character in its fifth season, suggesting he probably won't make a return for the upcoming Community film.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-donald-glover>Donald Glover</h2></span><p>LAS VEGAS, NV - SEPTEMBER 21: Childish Gambino performs onstage during the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena on September 21, 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Though Glover was hailed as one of the best performers on the show, his post-Community career is arguably more prolific than any of his co-stars combined. Glover performed stand-up comedy for Comedy Central, created and starred in the hit FX series Atlanta, and launched a multi-platinum music career under the alias Childish Gambino. Glover has also starred as young Lando Calrissian in 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For the upcoming Community movie, Donald Glover was widely regarded as the hardest member of the original cast to bring back due to his busy schedule. Glover previously let it slip in an interview with GQ that he had signed on to <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">appear in the film</a>, though the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes have caused massive scheduling changes, calling his participation into question.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>TeeJay Small is a professional humorist, pop culture columnist, and an avid enjoyer of all things hip hop.
