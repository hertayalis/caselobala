The celebrity child was born with a silver spoon in her mouth with her name in the media since her birth.</p><p>Unfortunately, Steve and Sarah went their separate ways in 2021. How is Violet coping with her parents' separation? Let's uncover Howey's family dynamics and other life details, including her near-death experience.</p><h2>Violet Moon Howey Age & Birthday</h2><p>Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey welcomed their daughter, Violet, on March 1, 2015. She is currently being raised in her birthplace Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/28/Sarah%20Shahi%20holding%20her%20only%20daughter,%20Violet%20Moon%20Howey%20-1703786199978.jpg><p>Shahi's daughter shares her birthday with her twin brother, <strong>Knox Blue</strong>. When Violet was born, her famous mother said</p><p>"I never thought I would be one of those wacky chicks who say, 'I loved my labor,' but I loved every part of it. It was the best day of my life,"&nbsp;</p><h3>How Sarah Shahi's Daughter Got Named Violet Moon?</h3><p>The <i>True Lies</i> actor Steve Howey revealed the naming process of their daughter to the publication. The actor said initially, Howey and Shahi were planning to name their daughter 'Moon'. It is the english translation of Sarah's mother.</p><p>But Moon best fits as the middle name. Therefore, Sarah and Steve came up with Violet as their daughter's name. It is a proud moment for Howey as she carries her maternal grandmother's name.</p><h2>Violet Moon Howey's Parents Married Life</h2><p>Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey are no longer together. They separated in 2021 after being 18 years together. The former pair tied the knot on February 7, 2009, in Las Vegas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/28/Violet%20Moon%20Howey's%20parents,%20Steve%20Howey%20and%20Sarah%20Shahi,%20rocking%20black%20shades-1703786003712.jpg"><p>Violet's parents first met on the set of the TV show <i>Reba</i> in 2004. While Shahi had a guest role, Howey was portraying the character of Reba McIntyre's son-in-law.</p><p>The <i>Black Adam</i> actress Sarah does not consider her marriage life with Steve as a failure. Despite having ups and downs during their last ten years of togetherness, She <a href=# rel=nofollow>said</a></p><p>"We were together for a very long time. We were together for 18 years. That's not a failure. That was a long time. But the last 10 years we really did struggle."</p><h2>Know About Howey's Siblings</h2><p>Violet is one of Sarah Shahi children. She has two brothers named <a href=#><strong>William Wolf Howey</strong></a> and Knox Blue. As aforementioned, Knox is her twin brother while William is her big brother.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/28/Violet%20Moon%20Howey's%20family%20picture-1703785890578.jpg"><p>The Howey siblings share a close bond. They are often spotted together with Shahi and her ex-husband. Despite their separation, Sarah and Steve have not let it affect the children.</p><p>The <i>Sex/Life</i> actress is a private person. She does not like to share the picture of her children. However, Sarah talked about her experience of breastfeeding her twins, Violet and Knox.</p><h2>Violet Moon Howey's Net Worth & Lifestyle</h2><p>As Howey is just a kid and not involved in any professional activities, she has no net worth of her own. Like <a href=#><strong>Amaya Josephine Hermann</strong></a>, Violet depends on her parents' wealth to support her lifestyle.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Speaking of which, Violet's parents are millionaires. Sarah Shahi boasts a net worth of <strong>$4 Million</strong>. Similarly, Steve Howey has <strong>$2 Million</strong> worth of fortune.</p><p>Undoubtedly, Howey is living a rich lifestyle. Blessed with rich parents, she is privileged. Violet certainly goes to a reputed school in her hometown.</p><h2>Sarah Shahi's Daughter, Violet, Near Death Experience</h2><p>The <i>Bad Therapy</i> actress Sarah Shahi believes in giving natural delivery. So, she decided to give birth to her twins at home with the help of a midwife.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/28/Violet%20Moon%20Howey%20and%20her%20brothers%20at%20the%20time%20of%20her%20birth-1703786573751.jpg><p>Although Shahi successfully gave birth to her twins, there were some complications. Her daughter, Howey, had a near-death experience.</p><p>Violet's neck was wrapped twice with the umbilical cord. She was not breathing and her skin was blue. However, after some medical procedures, Howey took her first breath.</p><h2>Sarah Shahi & Steve Howey Have Moved On</h2><p>Howey and Shahi separated in 2021. Following their divorce, the ex-couple has moved on. Violet Moon Howey's parents have found solace in the arms of their respective partners.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/28/Adam%20Demos%20and%20Sarah%20Shah%20Portrayed%20As%20Brad%20Simon%20and%20Billie%20Connelly%20Resp.%20In%20The%20Netflix%20Series,%20Sex_Life-1703785485482.jpg><p>Shahi is currently <a href=#>dating her boyfriend</a>, Adam Demos. They two have been together since her split with Steve. On the other hand, Howey appears to be <a href=#>living a single life</a>.</p><h2>Violet Moon's Parents' Law Suit</h2><p>Did you know? Sarah Shahi and Steve Howey's former nanny accused them of mocking her religion. According to Sarah Alaseri, the nanny, Violet's parents ridiculed her religion.</p><p>Alaseri said that the former pair made fun of her Muslim dress, praying with a scarf on her head, and fasting rituals. Not only this, the nanny also revealed that the Sex/Life actress showed a picture of her private genitals.</p><p>Sarah allegedly grabbed the backside of Alaseri. But, the nanny, requested the case to be dismissed. It is still unsure why she dismissed the case.</p><p>For more interesting bio & gossip, Visit <a href=#>MARRIEDCELEB</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jq%2BgqKSVqXquu86nZKGnp5rG</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html&text=Near-Death%20Experience%2c%20Family%20Dynamics%2c%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20More&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html&title=Near-Death%20Experience%2c%20Family%20Dynamics%2c%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html&title=Near-Death%20Experience%2c%20Family%20Dynamics%2c%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html&title=Near-Death%20Experience%2c%20Family%20Dynamics%2c%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fviolet-moon-howey.html&description=Near-Death%20Experience%2c%20Family%20Dynamics%2c%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20More" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./potomac-housewives-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Potomac Housewives Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hunter-dickinson-age-wiki-biography-wife-children-salary-net-worth-parents-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hunter Dickinson Age, Wiki, Biography, Wife, Children, Salary, Net Worth, Parents">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
