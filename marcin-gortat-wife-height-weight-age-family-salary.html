After two years with his new team, Marcin Gortat was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the second round of the 2005 NBA season with the 57th pick.&nbsp;However, the player chose to stay in Germany for another year to continue his development.&nbsp;The following season, his team won the German national championship and, for the first time in its history, played EuroLeague basketball in the 2006-07 season.</span></p><p><span>In August 2007, Gortat joined the NBA and joined the Orlando Magic who had acquired his trade rights from the team that drafted him.&nbsp;Gortat spent some time with Anaheim Arsenal in the NBA Development League before he could make his debut on March 1, 2008, playing just 6 games that season, averaging 3.0 points and 2.7 rebounds per game.&nbsp;The player didn’t enjoy much playing time as he was used as a substitute for Dwight Howard.&nbsp;However, he was lucky enough to boast that he was the only Polish player to have played in the NBA Finals when the team got there.&nbsp;2009.</span></p><p><span>In December 2010, Marcin Gortat was traded to the Phoenix Suns with whom he enjoyed very well.&nbsp;Previously averaging around 12 minutes per game, Gortat was now an integral part of the Suns squad and was averaging around 30 minutes per game.&nbsp;His time with the Suns, however, lasted three seasons before being traded to the Washington Wizards.&nbsp;From 2013 to 2018 Gortat, who now went by the moniker ‘Polish Hammer’, came very close to a double-double despite actually pulling off the feat in 2016-17.</span></p><h2><strong><span>What is his salary?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Marcin Gortat’s last contract was for a five-year deal worth $60 million agreed in July 2014, which means he earns an average of $12 million a year.&nbsp;The NBA veteran’s earnings after 11 years weren’t as high when he joined the association in 2007. His first deal was a two-year, $1.13 million deal with Orlando.&nbsp;In 2009, after signing a five-year, $34 million deal with the Dallas Mavericks, that offer was matched and he had to stay with the Magic as he was a restricted free agent.&nbsp;This agreement was reached in 2014, when he then wrote his current contract.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Marcin Gortat Family</span></strong></h2><p><span>As mentioned above, Marcin Gortat comes from a family of athletes.&nbsp;His father is a Polish boxer who won two bronze medals at the 1972 and 1976 Summer Olympics in the light heavyweight (-75 kg) division.&nbsp;His mother also represented Poland in the national volleyball team.&nbsp;Marcin’s older brother Robert is also an athlete and he followed in their father’s footsteps to become a boxer.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Does he have a wife?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The details of Marcin Gortat’s love life are at odds with a few posts, he says he is in a relationship and might even be married, while others claim he is very single at the moment.&nbsp;The woman who would have been in the life of the basketball player is the popular Polish model Anna Kociuga, also called Anya Gortat.</span></p><p><span>Gortat reportedly met the 5-foot-10-inch-tall, 125-pound heavy model whose body measurements are 25-34-36 inches, in 2009. They reportedly moved in together, but due to their conflicting work schedules, they were unable to spend meaningful time together and strengthen their relationship.&nbsp;Gortat and Kociuga eventually decided to end their relationship and it’s unclear whether the two stayed in touch or showed a willingness to do so in the future.</span></p><p><span>The Clippers center has made it known that he will be looking to start a family in the near future, adding that he is unsure if he can continue playing after his current contract, which ends in July 2019.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Height, weight and other facts</span></strong></h2><p><strong><span>Birth name:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Marcin Gortat</span></p><p><strong><span>Date of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;February 17, 1984</span></p><p><strong><span>Place of birth:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Lodz, Poland</span></p><p><strong><span>Height:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m)</span></p><p><strong><span>Weight:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;240 lbs (109 kg)</span></p><p><strong><span>Zodiac sign:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Aquarius</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGilkaewqrqMoKarrJGperi1xZ5koZ2ZnLW1edaeoKCgpGKuqLGMn5imoZyuerSty5qpsmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html&text=Marcin%20Gortat%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Salary&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html&title=Marcin%20Gortat%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html&title=Marcin%20Gortat%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html&title=Marcin%20Gortat%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarcin-gortat-wife-height-weight-age-family-salary.html&description=Marcin%20Gortat%20Wife%2c%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Family%2c%20Salary" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nafissa-benzema-wiki-boyfriend-net-worth-height.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nafissa Benzema- Wiki, Boyfriend, Net Worth, Height">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kristin-chenoweth-husband-is-kristen-married.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kristin Chenoweth Husband: Is Kristen Married?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
