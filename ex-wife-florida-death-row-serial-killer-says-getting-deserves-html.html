It said Magnum, as in Dodge Magnum.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She was menstruating and she made sure she left blood evidence on the backseat of his car. She could tell the direction they were driving and when they were on Interstate 275 north of Tampa. When she was brought to the killer's apartment, she counted the steps up to the second floor. When he let her use the bathroom, she made sure she left fingerprints everywhere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And she knew she couldn't make him angry. She appealed to a glimmer of kindness he showed while he washed her hair after raping her repeatedly. She asked what made him do what he did. He said he had suffered a bad breakup and hated women. She told him he seemed nice and that maybe she could be his girlfriend. She wouldn't tell anyone.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Long later got Noland dressed. He let her loose and told her not to take the blindfold off for five minutes. She got out of the car and tripped on the curb. Long caught her before she fell. Terrified, she waited for what seemed like an eternity and pulled off the blindfold. She was in front of a tree in another churchyard.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To this day, she claims that tree as hers, and included it in the design of a T-shirt she made to mark Long's execution.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And she's joined the ranks of the law enforcement officers who captured Long. She's a deputy with the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, the same department she helped lead to Long's arrest.</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/gb/news/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWKEcYKSbG1yZ3Wteri1xZ5kf6Sfp7alrYydnJqsmGK%2FsMOMrJyroZGheqy1y6Wcq2Wjlsa0ecaeq62hnpx6pbHSnqmvnaNjtbW5yw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html&text=Ex-wife%20of%20Florida%20death%20row%20serial%20killer%20says%20he%20is%20getting%20what%20he%20deserves&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html&title=Ex-wife%20of%20Florida%20death%20row%20serial%20killer%20says%20he%20is%20getting%20what%20he%20deserves" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html&title=Ex-wife%20of%20Florida%20death%20row%20serial%20killer%20says%20he%20is%20getting%20what%20he%20deserves" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html&title=Ex-wife%20of%20Florida%20death%20row%20serial%20killer%20says%20he%20is%20getting%20what%20he%20deserves" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fex-wife-florida-death-row-serial-killer-says-getting-deserves-html.html&description=Ex-wife%20of%20Florida%20death%20row%20serial%20killer%20says%20he%20is%20getting%20what%20he%20deserves" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./guadalupe-rodriguez-bio-all-to-know-about-jeniffer-lopez-mother.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Guadalupe Rodrguez bio: All to know about Jeniffer Lopez mother">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./page.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Citrus Cabbage Salad">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
