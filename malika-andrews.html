"How much does it cost to book Malika Andrews for an event?" is a frequent question we get. The final Malika Andrews booking price is contingent on many variables and the booking fee we may show is based on a range derived from our past experience with what will Malika Andrews charge for an event. An example fee to book Malika Andrews is in the starting range of $75,000-$149,999. However, any recent popularity change would cause a price fluctuation well beyond this example. Also, their speaking fee might be different than the fee shown for the cost to perform or to just appear. Popularity, career stage, along with current demand will cause fluctuations in their speaking price as well. The final booking price may be more than what is shown, but you should at least have a budget within that range for them to consider an appearance, performance or speaking engagement.</p><p>There is low probability to book Malika Andrews for a party with anything substantially less than the published booking cost price range.

If your budget does not factor that in, then there is no benefit for them to want to be hired.
