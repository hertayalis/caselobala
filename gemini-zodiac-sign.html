Annually, roughly between May 21 to June 20, the sun moves through the third sign of the zodiac, Gemini, symbolized by the Twins.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the excitable, four-week lead-up to the Summer Solstice, it's easy to find every excuse to connect and socialize, research and daydream out loud about adventures down the road, and perfect your warm-weather look. This energy is influenced by Gemini, an air sign associated with sharing and communicating, learning, and constantly being on the move. These traits are owed to Gemini's ruling planet, Mercury, which oversees communication, transportation, and technology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything you need to know about the communicative, creative, and changeable sign.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gemini-personality-traits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gemini Personality Traits</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Those born between May 21 and June 20 can generally conclude that their sun sign is Gemini. (It's not definitive, because the sun moves between signs on different days annually.) Also note that while we tend to refer to ourselves as our sun sign, it's just one detail of a natal chart, which is basically a unique snapshot of the sky when you were born. But it's a detail that helps color your core sense of self, identity, personal style, self-esteem, and confidence.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The chatterbox of the zodiac</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typical sun in Gemini traits include being quick-witted, outgoing, inquisitive, agile, charming, and adaptable. All of these characteristics reflect themes covered by the Third House of Communication, which Gemini rules. The Third House covers all the ways we connect with others, language, technology, early environment and childhood, sibling bonds, community, and short-distance travel.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The information gatherer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Given that messenger Mercury colors Gemini's personality so strongly, the air sign tends to be eager to learn anything and everything, from the latest iOS to the hottest <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>street styles of the season</a>. Data, research, and the top trending news stories are like a go-to sugar fix for Geminis, and they have an appetite for discussing it all with anyone and everyone up for engaging. Social to their core, they need conversation and connection to thrive in just about any situation. Lovers of language, they adore dirty talk just as much as a forever animated group text and hours spent making their mark on social media platforms.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The mutable air sign</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Every sign is assigned a quality (cardinal, mutable, or fixed), which explains the sign's basic energy. There's a cardinal, mutable, and fixed sign within every element (fire, earth, air, water). Gemini is the mutable one of the air group, which is just one more reason they're known to be adaptable at best and flighty at worst. They're able to shift and change from moment to moment, which can make them both easy-going and fickle.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini's best personality traits:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curious, enthusiastic, clever, and friendly, you can count on a Gemini to bring excitement, animated conversation, and fun-loving, lively energy to the table. They're your favorite plus-one to that fashion show, the friend you can rely on to spread the word about your next group hang or to spontaneously join you for whichever workout you feel like trying on a whim.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini's worst personality traits:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As they're mercurial and dualistic (they are the Twins, after all), Gemini's changeability earns them a rep for being two-faced, superficial, flaky, and capricious. They'll struggle to make up their minds or say one thing and then contradict themselves a couple of minutes later. They're also masters of using language to make their way in the world, at times talking for the sake of talking. So, their words could lack weight. Their thirst for information and adaptability makes them super-communicators. But they often lack the grounding required for follow-through.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-geminis-are-like-in-love--bed></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Geminis Are Like in Love & Bed</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini romance style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a potential partner is blowing up your DMs with flirty, inquisitive chatting, is all about hopping on a Zoom call at a moment's notice, and possibly hasn't committed to anything beyond the next text they're gonna send (and maybe not even that), you might be seeing someone born under the influence of airy, linguistically acrobatic Gemini energy. The air sign loves connecting mentally with anyone they're relating to, and that absolutely translates to their love lives. So does their breezy and noncommittal vibe. They're all about exploring a wide variety of options, flirting through endless conversation, and then, maybe once their attention has been captured by someone who keeps them stimulated mentally, they'll consider settling down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gemini's ultimate date night is one that will fuel their curiosity. Think group set-ups where they can converse and connect with different personalities, activities that allow them to soak up new info and then discuss what they learned (like a class or a museum tour), or a buzz-worthy experience they can report back on via Instagram Story (like a movie premiere or restaurant opening).</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini sexual style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gemini's chatty, always shifting personality is front and center in the bedroom. They're vocal, often wanting to share their desires out loud. They might also be into making or hearing sexy noises (e.g. moaning, breathing in their ear). And their affinity for communication is very much a part of their preferred form of foreplay. They'll consider long catch-ups, inside jokes, or analysis of a favorite band or politician the lead-up to a steamy sex session. As they get more comfortable, they might enjoy long-winded sexting sessions and dirty talk. Given that their ruling planet is cerebral Mercury, don't be surprised if they seem more satisfied by sexy talk than sex itself. Still, once you're finally one-on-one, they'll be eager to please and interested in experimentation, wanting to try a new technique they researched or heard about from a friend, or proposing a variety of position changes.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gemini-compatibility></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gemini Compatibility</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wondering how Gemini matches up with your sign as a friend, a lover, a colleague, or in terms of any other one-on-one relationship? Here are their go-to companions and most problematic pairings:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Most compatible with Gemini:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Signs that share the same element tend to be the most simpatico (e.g. two water signs, like Scorpio and Cancer). This is especially the case for two air signs, both of whom lead with mental energy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Air is also traditionally compatible with fire because the two elements complement one another. The two signs share certain attributes, like being free-spirited, independent, speedy, and social. That said, a Gemini often hits it off with similarly social, flirtatious Libra, people-loving, intellectual Aquarius, or dynamic, fun-loving Leo.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Least compatible with Gemini:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with most of the zodiac signs, opposites can attract — and Gemini and Sagittarius often connect on their shared desire to take to the sky and go on an impromptu adventure, experiencing and connecting with the world. But because both are mutable and naturally changeable, they could struggle to commit and feel grounded in their bond.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gemini is also square (the most challenging angle that can exist between two signs) detail-oriented earth sign Virgo and empathic water sign Pisces. Unless they have other positive aspects in their natal charts, Gemini can respect these two other mutable signs for their ability to switch up their approach based on the way the wind is blowing, but emotionally, they're too changeable to solidify a connection.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-if-you-have-gemini-elsewhere-in-your-chart></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What If You Have Gemini Elsewhere in Your Chart?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As mentioned previously, the sun sign is one of many aspects of a natal chart. When you were born, the moon and all the planets in our solar system were in one of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>12 signs</a> and a particular position — all of which help to inform your personality and areas of your life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what it means if Gemini shows up in any of the main areas of your chart:</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Moon</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The moon, which spends about two to three days in each sign, influences your emotions and intuition. If it was in Gemini at the time of your birth, you have a tendency to intellectualize your emotions and, in a way, for you, talking is synonymous with feeling. You're happiest when you feel like you have the green light to express what's in your heart in an airy, changeable, free-spirited way.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Mercury</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_66-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mercury, which spends about two to three weeks in a sign, shapes your communication style. If it was in Gemini when you were born, you're extremely curious, energized, and perhaps scattered in your thinking and speaking. Self-expression is very much your jam, given that Mercury is at home in the sign of the Twins, and therefore, the energy of the planet and the sign are in sync. You're constantly craving information input and share it just as readily as you receive it. You might put this placement to use professionally, pursuing a career in communication or technology.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Venus</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Venus, which remains in a sign for about three to five weeks, influences how you behave in relationships and how you attract others. If you were born with the planet of love and beauty in Gemini, you use words and language as your go-to instrument for expressing how you feel. You're wary of getting "tied down," as that can feel counter to your mercurial nature. But you'll eagerly pursue and stay interested in someone who stokes your appetite for cerebral stimulation, either with their adventurous spirit, social prowess, or sharp-witted conversational skills. And when it comes to your personal style, you're likely known as a trendsetter who's particular about cultivating an IG-worthy look.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Mars</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mars, which remains in a sign for six or seven weeks, affects your energy, strength, sexual style, and how you experience courage. If you were born while the fiery, dynamic, fighter planet was in mutable, airy Gemini, communication and action are synonymous in your opinion. You prefer talking through your next move before diving in, and as a born multitasker, you prefer having an array of engaging to-dos to tackle at any given time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_74-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Gemini Ascendant (or Rising)</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_75-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your ascendant or rising sign influences how you present yourself to the world. As a Gemini ascendant, you come off as social, playful, and even impish, chatty, and quick-witted. You might give off the vibe that you lead with your head over your heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6Kdnqukrrmme8aepKKmmWLHsLDImppmq5mcuw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html&text=Personality%20Traits%2c%20Dates%2c%20and%20Compatibility&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html&title=Personality%20Traits%2c%20Dates%2c%20and%20Compatibility" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html&title=Personality%20Traits%2c%20Dates%2c%20and%20Compatibility" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html&title=Personality%20Traits%2c%20Dates%2c%20and%20Compatibility" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgemini-zodiac-sign.html&description=Personality%20Traits%2c%20Dates%2c%20and%20Compatibility" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rihannas-super-bowl-halftime-show-everything-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rihannas Super Bowl halftime show choreographed by Parris Goebel: What you need to know">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mike-gallo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Gallo Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
