She was born on September 5, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York. Weinshall graduated from Brooklyn College in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. She then went on to earn a Master of Public Administration degree from New York University in 1977. Weinshall began her career in public service in 1978 when she was appointed as a budget analyst for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She then went on to serve as the Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation from 1994 to 2000. In 2000, Weinshall was appointed as the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation, a position she held until 2007. During her tenure, she oversaw the implementation of numerous transportation projects, including the expansion of the city's bike lane network and the installation of pedestrian safety measures. In 2007, Weinshall was appointed as the Chief Operating Officer of The New York Public Library, a position she still holds today. In this role, she is responsible for overseeing the library's operations, including budgeting, personnel, and facilities. Weinshall is married to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The couple has two children together.</p><table class="table table-col-2"><tbody readability=0.92270531400966><tr><td>Popular As</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Occupation</td><td>Chief Operating Officer at The New York Public Library</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td><a href=#>70 years old</a></td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac Sign</td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td>Born</td><td>5 September, <a href=#>1953</a></td></tr><tr><td>Birthday</td><td>5 September</td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td>Brooklyn, New York, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>We recommend you to check the complete list of Famous People born on 5 September.

In her new position at the City University of New York, Weinshall has largely steered clear of New York City transportation policy issues—until the redesign of Prospect Park West in the spring of 2010. Opposed to the installation of a bicycling facility on her own street, Weinshall helped to organize a group calling itself Neighbors for Better Bike Lanes (NBBL) aimed at removing the bike lane.</p><p>On January 29, 2007, Weinshall announced that she was stepping down as DOT commissioner and would take a job as CUNY's Vice Chancellor for Facilities Planning, Construction and Management. Her last day as commissioner was April 13, 2007. She was succeeded by <a href=#>Janette Sadik-Khan</a>.</p><p>The Hudson River Greenway, a project of New York State Department of Transportation and Hudson River Park rather than NYCDOT, was improved. DOT installed bike lanes linking the East River bridges and Downtown Brooklyn, which is home to a growing cycling community. In 2006, Bicycling Magazine named New York one of the top bicycling cities in the United States.</p><p>Andrew Vesselinovitch, former Bicycle Program Director at DOT, resigned in 2006, accusing Weinshall's DOT of foot dragging on bicycle safety and deliberately sabotaging fixes to known hazards on the Williamsburg Bridge. Vesselinovitch claimed that Weinshall prevented him from installing bike lanes, and that Deputy Commissioner Michael Primeggia told him to "butt out" when he attempted to fix bumps on the Williamsburg Bridge that were costing New York City millions in lawsuits. Following Vesselinovitch’s departure, Weinshall appointed Ryan Russo as Director for Street Management and Safety, overseeing the department’s bicycle and pedestrian initiatives. Russo previously worked in DOT’s Brooklyn Borough Commissioner’s Office where he developed and implemented a number of cycling and pedestrian safety improvements in Downtown Brooklyn.</p><p>To enhance traffic flow in the city's most congested area, Midtown Manhattan, Weinshall and Mayor Bloomberg announced the 2003 THRU Streets Program. This program, which prohibits turns off of designated streets between 3rd and 6th Avenues, has reduced cross-town travel times by 25% and increased vehicle speeds by 33%. Weinshall considered this project one of her agency's most ambitious and successful projects. Pedestrian fences were installed near Rockefeller Center to separate traffic. Larger street signs to provide better visibility to drivers also promoted the usual goal of the department, "to keep the traffic moving" as she often stated it.</p><p>The normally low profile job of DOT Commissioner came into the spotlight following the 2003 Staten Island Ferry crash that killed 11 passengers. After the deadly crash, Weinshall came under harsh criticism for allowing patronage relationships to compromise the safety of the ferry operations.</p><p>Since 2003, DOT has made significant progress to enhance safety on the Staten Island Ferry. In April 2004, Weinshall appointed Captain James C. DeSimone, a 30-year maritime industry veteran to serve as Chief Operating Officer for the Staten Island Ferry and shortly thereafter appointed <a href=#>Margaret Gordon</a> a maritime safety and security expert to serve as Executive Director of Safety and Security at the ferry. In October 2005, after a year long effort to develop and implement a comprehensive safety management system for the Staten Island Ferry, the American Bureau of Shipping presented the Department of Transportation with a "Voluntary Document of Compliance Certificate" for the DOT Staten Island Ferry Division and "Voluntary Safety Management Certificates" for all operational ferryboats. The New York City Department of Transportation is now the first ferry operator in the United States to voluntarily comply with this internationally accepted safety regime.</p><p>Iris Weinshall was appointed Commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation by then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani on September 8, 2000. Commissioner Weinshall was one of a handful of Giuliani department heads to be reappointed by Mayor Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>From 1988-1996, Weinshall served as Deputy Commissioner for Management and Budget at the New York City Department of Environmental Protection. She also served as the First Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services before being named Commissioner of the city's Department of Transportation, a post she held from 2000 to 2007.</p><p>Iris Weinshall (born September 5, 1953) is the Chief Operating Officer of The New York Public Library, former vice chancellor at the City University of New York and a former commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation. Weinshall was appointed Chief Operating Officer by the Library in July 2014, and she began her tenure on September 1, 2014. She is the wife of U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer.</p><p>Not long after she assumed the post of NYC DOT commissioner, the issue of Queens Boulevard came to the forefront. For decades, Queens Boulevard had been the most dangerous road in New York City. During the period 1950-2000, over 27,000 people were injured on Queens Boulevard. From 1980-84, 40 people were killed on a 2.5 mile length section of Queens Boulevard. From 2002-04 there were 393 injuries and eight deaths. Queens Boulevard became known as the Boulevard of Death in the media, and the community began an outcry to make the road safer. New York Newsday and the New York Daily News got into a circulation war on the issue of the Boulevard of Death, and the DOT was under pressure to take action. Weinshall implemented pedestrian improvements on Queens Boulevard, including longer pedestrian crossing times, a lowering of the speed limit from 35&nbsp;mph to 30&nbsp;mph and the construction of new pedestrian median refuges. The safety improvements have proven successful, without the predicted backups.</p><p>The Staten Island Ferry system transports 65,000 passengers a day on the five-mile ride between St. George Terminal on Staten Island and Whitehall Terminal in Manhattan. The boats operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and have been a vital municipal service since 1905. During Weinshall’s tenure, DOT has taken a number of steps to modernize the Staten Island Ferry service. In February 2005, Weinshall joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg at the opening of the new Whitehall Ferry Terminal in Lower Manhattan. Later that year, in May, DOT celebrated the grand opening of the renovated St. George in Staten Island. Since 2004, DOT has also introduced three new, state of the art ferries: the Guy V. Molinari, John J. Marchi, and most recently the Spirit of America. The $40 million, 310 foot vessels were built by the Manitowoc Marine Group in Marinette, Wisconsin and replaced the Kennedy class ferries, which have been in operation for more than 40 years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnr%2Bqv4ywnKKmo52urbg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2firis-weinshall.html&text=Iris%20Weinshall%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2firis-weinshall.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2firis-weinshall.html&title=Iris%20Weinshall%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2firis-weinshall.html&title=Iris%20Weinshall%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2firis-weinshall.html&title=Iris%20Weinshall%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2firis-weinshall.html&description=Iris%20Weinshall%20Biography%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Husband%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./229303-nick-cannon-comes-for-eminem-fans-on-used-to-look-up-to-you-new-song.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nick Cannon Comes For Eminem Fans On &amp;quot;Used To Look Up To You&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dells-xps-13-2in1-7390-available-intels-10th-gen-core-cpus-inside.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Intels 10th Gen Core CPUs Inside">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
